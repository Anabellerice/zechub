## Introduction
Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a form of digital currency issued by a country's central bank. It represents a digital form of a nation's fiat currency and is distinct from decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. CBDCs are gaining traction globally as countries explore the potential benefits and risks associated with adopting digital currencies.

## Features of CBDC
__1. Digital Representation of Fiat Currency__
CBDC is a digital form of a country's official currency, providing a secure and centralized digital alternative to physical cash.

__2. Centralized Control__
Issued and regulated by the central bank, CBDC allows for direct control over the money supply and monetary policy.

__3. Accessibility__
CBDC aims to be accessible to the general public, promoting financial inclusion and reducing reliance on traditional banking systems.

__4. Programmability__
Some CBDCs may offer programmable features, allowing for smart contracts and automation in financial transactions.

## Risks Associated with CBDC
__1. Privacy Concerns__
CBDC transactions are traceable, raising concerns about individual privacy and surveillance.

__2. Cybersecurity Threats__
The digital nature of CBDC makes it susceptible to cyber threats, requiring robust security measures.

__3. Financial Stability__
CBDC adoption may impact the stability of the traditional banking system, leading to potential disruptions.

__4. Implementation Challenges__
Introducing CBDC requires addressing technical, regulatory, and logistical challenges for seamless integration.

## CBDC Status in Selected Countries
__1. China: Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP)__

__Risks__: Concerns include increased surveillance, potential impact on commercial banks, and challenges related to cross-border transactions.

__Status__: China has conducted extensive pilot programs, and the digital yuan is in active use in various cities.

### Safe Aspects:

__Cybersecurity Measures:__ If DCEP has robust cybersecurity measures in place, including encryption protocols and secure transaction channels, it can enhance the overall safety of the digital currency.

__Government Commitment:__ The safety of DCEP is also contingent on the Chinese government's commitment to user privacy and data protection.

### Concerns:
__Surveillance Risks:__ The traceability of transactions raises concerns about increased surveillance. If not properly managed, it could compromise user privacy.


__2. Sweden: E-Krona__
