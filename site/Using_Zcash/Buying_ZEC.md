# Buying Zcash

In order to use Zcash in private (shielded) transactions, you need to have ZEC. To get ZEC, you'll need to buy it. You can buy ZEC from a number of different exchanges, which we will list below. It is recommended that you use an exchange that supports shielded withdrawals.

## Buy ZEC directly in [Zashi](https://electriccoin.co/zashi/) w/ Coinbase Integration

If you already have a Coinbase account, you can now enjoy the convenience of topping up your ZEC balance right from the wallet. The “Buy or transfer with Coinbase” feature allows you to log into your Coinbase account and complete the purchase or transfer in minutes, all without leaving the Zashi app. For Zashi users in the U.S. without a Coinbase account, the “Buy with debit card” option introduces an unprecedented level of accessibility, enabling users to purchase up to $500 of ZEC per week with just a U.S. phone number and a debit card. Both buying options offered by Zashi’s Coinbase Onramp seamlessly facilitate self-custody of ZEC, which is crucial to realizing the full potential of Zcash. In addition to that, ZEC stored in Zashi must be shielded in order to be spent. This ensures the highest level of privacy for every outgoing transaction. Zashi users can shield the transparent ZEC they receive from Coinbase with a click of a button inside the wallet. Just go to your Balances screen and tap the Shield and Consolidate Funds button.
