20% Dev Fund Lockbox

 Introduction

The 20% Dev Fund Lockbox is the funding mechanism chosen for the next generation of the Zcash development fund. This option allocates 20% of Zcash block rewards to a selected lockbox, guaranteeing that resources are available to support the Zcash ecosystem's continuing development and upkeep.

 Decision-Making Process

The decision to implement the 20% Dev Fund Lockbox was reached through a comprehensive community-driven process. This included two rounds of Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) polls, as well as several ecosystem-wide polls. These polls allowed a broad spectrum of stakeholders to voice their opinions and contribute to the decision-making process.

 Round 1: ZCAP Poll
The initial round of polling involved members of the ZCAP. This group, comprised of various community members, was tasked with evaluating several proposals for the future of the dev fund. The first round of voting helped narrow down the options to the most viable and popular choices.
The following table is the result of member voting for the approval of each of the six ideas for a new Dev Fund, as well as for allowing the present Dev Fund to finish without establishing a new Dev Fund.

 Ecosystem Polls
Following the initial ZCAP poll, additional polls were conducted across the wider Zcash ecosystem. These polls aimed to capture a more extensive range of opinions from miners, developers, users, and other stakeholders. The input from these ecosystem polls was crucial in understanding the broader community's preferences and concerns.

Round 2: ZCAP Poll
A second round of ZCAP polling was conducted to finalize the decision. This round focused on the refined options that emerged from the first round and the ecosystem polls. The 20% Dev Fund Lockbox option emerged as the preferred choice, reflecting a consensus among the various stakeholders.

The table below depicts the results of a poll conducted to indicate approval of direct and non-direct funding models, with the option of “I wish to reserve judgment until more information about a Non-Direct Funding Model is available”.

Conclusion
The 20% Dev Fund Lockbox represents a well-considered and community-approved mechanism for funding the ongoing development of Zcash. By ensuring a dedicated allocation of resources, this approach aims to sustain the growth and evolution of the Zcash ecosystem for years to come.
