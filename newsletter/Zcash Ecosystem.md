###Education Pieces 

We will be exploring a new Zcash feature, we will learn how file transfer works with Zcash. This video demonstrates how to use Wormhole and Zcash to transfer files between two computers. The process involves generating a secret code on one computer, sharing it with the other computer using a QR code, and then sending the file using Zcash shielded transactions. The file is automatically downloaded on the receiving computer once the transaction is confirmed.
